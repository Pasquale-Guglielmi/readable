# Welcome to my "Readable" react-redux web app!

## Project Overview
The Readable project is a simple content and comment "blog-like" web application bootstrapped with 
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). By using this app the user will be 
able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on 
posts and comments. User will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

## Why this project?
This content and comment structure is common across a large number of websites and applications, 
from news sites to blogs to aggregators like Hacker News and Reddit. By building this project, 
the student will gain an understanding of how Redux can function in a standard type of application.
